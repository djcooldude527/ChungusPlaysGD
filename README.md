This repository contains my Scratch/Turbowarp projects, along with html ports so you can play these games on pretty much any device. The .sb3 files are the Scratch/Turbowarp source code, you can use File / Load from your computer in the top bar of the site (preferably Turbowarp) to import the project, so you can make changes to the code and essentially make your own mod (but in the same way as a romhack really) of the game. I don't care wth you do with my stuff really. Just don't go putting completely unedited copies of my games on the Internet and claiming you made them yourself or some sht. For info on each and every one of these games, check the wiki tab on this repo.

Also, this repo is called ChungusPlaysGD because that's the name of my Scratch acc
